# OpenAIRewriter---Testing-

Hello everyone,

This is basically the same thing but this TextRewriter gets more updates/bigger updates. Expect bugs, this one will be in the testing phase and if it turns out well I will be uploading this one to the main TextRewriter.

The requirements you will need are just openai and python. Make sure you type this into your cmd: py -m pip install openai. You would also need to go to the OpenAI website and create an API key to continue.

With this new script, your API key is hidden and separated in a config file. Make sure you edit the config file and replace your_api_key with your API key. I added a lot of different features

Make sure you have fun and report any bugs.

KNOWN BUGS: The lower the temperature slider, the more the text rewriter is better.
